    ">\"This dataset contains primary categories of information on individual authors comprising gender, sexuality, UK residency, ethnicity, geography and details of educational background, including institutions where the authors acquired their degrees and their fields of study. Along with other similar projects, we aim to provide information to assess the cultural, social and political factors determining literary prestige. Our goal is to contribute to greater transparency in discussions around diversity and equity in literary prize cultures.\"\n",
